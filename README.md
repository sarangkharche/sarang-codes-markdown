## Motivation

A simple mardown editor I am planning to use to take notes and write markdown for my blog.

## Features

- System Controlled Dark Mode
- Export the raw .md file
- Optional Preview

## Development / Self Hosting

The app is a straightforward vuejs app and just a client sided one. You can set it up using the following steps.

**Prerequisite**

1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) at least v12
2. [git](https://git-scm.com/)

**Steps**

```sh
# clone this repo 
git clone https://github.com/barelyhuman/mark

# cd into it and install the basic dependencies
npm i 

# run the dev server to check if it's working (optional)
npm run dev 

# build the app into static files 
npm run build
```

## Contribute

The easiest way to contribute is to fork the project and raise PR's. Though, do inform the mainter as to what issue you pick up to avoid overlaps
